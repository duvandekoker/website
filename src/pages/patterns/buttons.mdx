## Overview

Buttons are common and vital elements because they help make content interactive across the
internet. They allow a user to take actions with a single click and are placed throughout a
page or workflow. Buttons use visual signifiers such as shape, color, and size to show that
a user can interact with them.

## Interface

**Primary buttons** are for the most important action in a given view. There is typically
one call-to-action on a page or view. **Default** buttons are for secondary actions.
**Basic buttons** are for repetitive or deemphasized actions in a given view.

## Size

The default button size is medium. In screens that have more information density, use small
buttons. Large buttons are mostly used in onboarding. Buttons and text inputs within the same
flow should be the same size.

## Content

Use clear, action-oriented language to help people choose the right action for them. A typical
construction is `Verb noun`. It’s OK and expected for Button labels to mirror the content of a
page or modal heading.

Lead with verbs and omit articles, pronouns, and punctuation. Avoid terse labels that need context
like "Yes," "No," or "Done." Buttons are sentence case, not title case or all caps. Use 1–4 words
and a maximum of 20 characters in English including spaces to adhere to internationalization guidelines.

## Interaction

**Loading buttons** display a dot loader inside when communicating loading progress. The dot loader
appears after the user has initiated an action, signifying the site is loading the next
action to occur. Buttons shouldn’t change size while loading.
